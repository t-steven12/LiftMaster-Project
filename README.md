# Lift Master Mobile Application
Lift Master is a React Native mobile application where users can track weightlifting exercises they completed.

Users can create, read, edit, and delete exercises they have logged into the application.

## Installation/Instructions
First, please download Expo Go in the Apple App Store(You can open this link for download: https://expo.dev/client). Currently, the application is only built for iOS.

Second, open the following link on your iOS device with the Expo Go app installed: exp://u.expo.dev/update/88793080-794e-48af-843b-3ef3e9a7d845.
If you cannot open the link by pressing on it, you can either copy and paste it into your preferred browser's address bar or scan the QR code with your Camera app below:

The application should now build and open in the Expo Go app. It can be accessed directly via the Expo Go app from now on without using the link or QR code above.
